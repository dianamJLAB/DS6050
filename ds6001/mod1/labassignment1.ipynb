    "Short Answer: There are at least 26 answers to this question. The problem with using Google/StackOverflow/ChatGPT first before trying to write pseodocode or an initial algorithm first is that you may not understand the basics of your problem and your may over or under engineer your problem by using another developer's code. Some of the answers presented on this Stack Overflow post are just developers having fun by trying to be as overly complex as possible, or trying to come up with special cases. It is unclear in the original question whether the user was trying to write re-usable, future-proof code, or just a one-time column rename. How to write the code would depend on that context. Only you may know the specific context of your data science task, and beware asking for help from people who may now appreciate the nuance of your task.\n",
    "\n",
    "**TLDR Answer:**\n",
    "The question is how to rename columns in a pandas dataframe. Pretty straightforward question. I'll try to count the answers in different proposed solutions in the stackoverflow post:\n",
    "1. There is one response to check the official pydata documentation: pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/text.html\n",
    "1. There is an option to use df.rename with only the columns parameter.\n",
    "1. There is a proposal to use pd.DataFrame function pd.DataFrame(...) with the columns='' parameter.\n",
    "1. There is a proposal to use df.rename with a dictionary of key value pairs of old column name new columns name with axis = 1.\n",
    "1. There is a proposal to use df.rename with a dictionary of key value pairs of old column name new columns name with axis = 'columns'.\n",
    "1. There is a proposal to use df.rename with a dictionary of key value pairs of old column name new columns name with no axis parameter.\n",
    "1. The three previous methods are described with and without inplace=True, so that you do or do not need to assign back to a new dataframe variable.\n",
    "1. A option ot us df.set_axis() with axis=1 and inplace=False to return a copy is proposed.\n",
    "1. Also, the method of just using df.columns = lst_of_column_names is also described.\n",
    "1. There is also a description of how to rename columns that need to replace a value using a lambda function.\n",
    "1. Futher down in the stackoverflow chain there are responses that show that the lambda function method has changed syntax a few times since the original version.\n",
    "1. There is a description of how to rename columns that need to strip a character/characters from the column names by using str.lstrip\n",
    "1. There is a description of how to rename columns that need to replace part of the column name string using the string replace function using df.columns = df.columns.str.replace('$', '')\n",
    "1. There is a method proposes that uses pd.concat([c for _, c in df.items()], axis=1, keys=new)\n",
    "1. There is a method that proposes reconstructing the dataframe using: pd.DataFrame(df.values, df.index, new). The author says this should only work if there is a single dtype for all columns.\n",
    "1. If there are multiple dtypes for columns the author says this method may work: pd.DataFrame(df.values, df.index, new).astype(dict(zip(new, df.dtypes)))\n",
    "1. The same author also proposes this solution using transpose() and set_index() for single dtype dataframes: df.T.set_index(np.asarray(new)).T\n",
    "1. And this for multi dtype dataframes: df.T.set_index(np.asarray(new)).T.astype(dict(zip(new, df.dtypes)))\n",
    "1. And this different type using lambda: df.rename(columns=lambda x, y=iter(new): next(y))\n",
    "1. A list comprehension method is described: df.columns = [col.strip('$') for col in df.columns]\n",
    "1. Using str.slice(1) is offered as a solution: df.columns = df.columns.str.slice(1)\n",
    "1. Ooo, regex is described: df = df.rename(columns=lambda x: re.sub('\\$','',x))\n",
    "1. Someone describes using a delimiter and \"future proofing\" the solution. (responders are just getting silly at this point)\n",
    "1. A Multi Index solution is offered with comma separated indices supported so that  characters could be stripped from column headers that weren't sequential.\n",
    "1. Someone provided an entire function that will replace column header names that does error checking on whether column names exist.\n",
    "1. Further down a respondent describes creating a dictionary map using the code:\n",
