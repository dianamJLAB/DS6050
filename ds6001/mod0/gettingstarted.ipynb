        "Welcome to DS 6001: Pactice and Application of Data Science. We are excited about this course and we hope you are too. Python is the most important tool for modern data science, and it includes incredible tools for running models for [machine learning and artificial intelligence](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/), processing [image](https://scikit-image.org/) and [video](https://github.com/scikit-video/scikit-video) files, generating [static](https://seaborn.pydata.org/) and [interactive](https://plotly.com/python/) visualizations, making [frontend dashboards](https://plotly.com/dash/) to show off results and publish them on the web, and many more tasks that involve skills that are in high demand now and will continue to be valued in the future. \n",
        "\n",
        "We understand the eagerness to jump right into advanced modeling, predictions, image recognition, and other cutting-edge work. But all of these skills involve the analysis of data, and are not possible unless you know exactly how to get data, load it into Python, and manipulate it so that it is in the form that packages for modeling and visualization expect. \n",
        "\n",
        "This course is all about the things you will need to do to get data, clean data, and explore data in Python. We will work on skills for data analysis and data science that are foundational and crucial for any career that involves work with data. We aren't going to spend a lot of time on the most flashy techniques, but we will emphasize the skills you need to make the flashy techniques possible. As an analogy, if we were practicing basketball, this course would be about dribbling, passing, and playing defense, not 360 degree slam dunks. If we were learning salsa dancing, we are practicing the basic steps, keeping the rhythm, and maintaining the connection with a dance partner, and not the moves that these [salsa masters](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Skl9QIkYzuU) can show off. \n",
        "\n",
        "This document is called a Jupyter notebook. It combines text with hypertext features, code, and the results of the code in a single document. We will be working with Jupyter notebooks a lot in this course. What follows is an **orientation guide**. Please read this document carefully, in its entirety, prior to the start of the class. There are also **exercises** included below. These exercises will not be graded, but they are designed to guide you through the steps to get all the required free software installed on your own computer and to understand how to get started writing your own Python code.\n",

        "Python is an open-source computing environment that can be used for many tasks, including data science. Python was [written between 1989 and 1991 by Guido van Rossum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Python) and was named in honor of [Monty Python's Flying Circus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCLp7zodUiI). The most up-to-date version of Python is version 3.8.3. Code that is written in Python version 2 often cannot be run by compilers that read Python version 3, so be careful when working with someone else's Python code and pay attention to the version number. \n",
        "\n",
        "Python was based on ABC, an earlier all-purpose programming language developed at the Centrum voor Wiskunde en Informatica in the Netherlands. Guido van Rossum aimed to replicate the best features of ABC while eliminating many of its flaws. In [van Rossum's words](https://www.python-course.eu/python3_history_and_philosophy.php):\n",
        "\n",
        "> I remembered all my experience and some of my frustration with ABC. I decided to try to design a simple scripting language that possessed some of ABC's better properties, but without its problems. So I started typing. I created a simple virtual machine, a simple parser, and a simple runtime. I made my own version of the various ABC parts that I liked. I created a basic syntax, used indentation for statement grouping instead of curly braces or begin-end blocks, and developed a small number of powerful data types: a hash table (or dictionary, as we call it), a list, strings, and numbers.\n",
        "\n",
        "The motivation behind Python was to create a programming language that is intuitive, understandable, and readable. Guido van Rossum and his collaborators expressed the principles behind the design on Python with a series of maxims, which include:\n",
        "\n",
        "* Beautiful is better than ugly.\n",
        "* Explicit is better than implicit.\n",
        "* Simple is better than complex.\n",
        "* Complex is better than complicated.\n",
        "* Flat is better than nested.\n",
        "* Sparse is better than dense.\n",
        "* Readability counts.\n",
        "* Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.\n",
        "* Although practicality beats purity.\n",
        "* Errors should never pass silently.\n",
        "* Unless explicitly silenced.\n",
        "* In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.\n",
        "* There should be one -- and preferably only one -- obvious way to do it.\n",
        "\n",
        "Although Python is frequently criticized for being [slow to accomplish some universal tasks](https://jakevdp.github.io/blog/2014/05/09/why-python-is-slow/), Python is incredibly popular and is the langauge in which most of the most widely-used data science software is written. [Python is so popular](https://www.kdnuggets.com/2017/07/6-reasons-python-suddenly-super-popular.html) because\n",
        "the language is (comparatively) easier to read and understand than other programming languages, because of the proliferation of excellent third-party extensions and the large and active developer community that supports these extensions, because of its functionality to work with big data, and because of its overall versatility.

Open source products are generally free to use and to distribute. For operating systems, Microsoft Windows and Mac OS are closed and proprietary, but Linux is free and open source. Open source work has a huge influence on the tech industry and on other industries. Many proprietary products such as smart phone operating systems are based on Linux, and likewise, a great deal of profitable analysis and proprietary software is created using Python, which is open source.\n",

While the proprietary options can be used to manage data and run statistical models, the open source options are considered superior for developing new approaches to working with data and for using cutting edge methods. The development of these open source environments is directly connected to the development of data science as a field of study. New methods can only be used by the community of scholars and practioners if there is software that implements the method. And while proprietary software like Stata and SAS do release updates with new functionality, they do so at a much less frequent rate than open source alternatives, and they may charge for these extensions.\n",

The choice between [Python vs. R](https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/r-or-python-for-data-analysis) evokes a great deal of debate on the internet. Both are excellent and highly marketable tools. R tends to be used more by people who work more closely with statistics, and Python tends to be used more by people whose work intersects with software development. That said, in recent years both R and Python have greatly expanded their functionality so that both can do statistics, software development, and many other tasks. Individual employers might have an in-house preference for R or Python, so the choice of which one you use might be dictated by the people you work with. Some people claim that one of these languages is \"easier\" than the other, but I think they are roughly equivalent in terms of their ease of use. Both are **object oriented** programming languages, and although there are differences in the way both languages approach dealing with programming objects, they can both handle the same kinds of operations.\n",

The disadvantage of Julia, at the moment, is that its community of developers is quite a bit smaller than those involved with Python and R, and because there are fewer developers there are fewer packages, so Julia lags a bit in functionality. That may change in the future if the Julia community grows.\n",

In other words, a package consists of many modules. In Python, these extensions need to be downloaded and **installed** just once (and once again anytime you want to update the extensions to their latest versions), but **imported** into every script or notebook you write in which you want to use the extension.

The console is designed to read and run single lines of Python code that you enter into the text bar at the bottom of the screen, and is a good place to go to enter the command to install new packages. A second option is to use the **command line interface** (CLI) on your computer. To use the CLI, within JupyterLab click on \"file\", then \"new\", then \"terminal\". Alternatively, on a Mac, you can click the magnifying glass in the upper-right corner of your screen, type \"Terminal\", and press enter.

Traditionally, if researchers would share their code at all, it was in a script that contained nothing but code. Raw code is hard for humans to read, even for people who are very good at coding. Instead of a huge dump of raw code, a Jupyter notebook does what is called **weaving**: combining code, results, and explanatory text together all in one readable document. The code is broken into small chunks of just a few lines, and the results of the code are displayed immediately following the code cell. It is best practice not to write more than a few lines of code in any one code cell. Seeing the results immediately after the code helps us understand what the code is doing. Jupyter notebooks are part of a scientific movement towards Reproducible Research -- the idea is that notebooks make scientific work much more transparent. It is a great idea to build a habit right now of writing text as you go along in a notebook so that you can produce work that fits with this movement. More detailed guidelines for how to [write Jupyter notebooks for scientific research](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/328380478_Ten_Simple_Rules_for_Reproducible_Research_in_Jupyter_Notebooks) are laid out by researchers at UC San Diego.\n",
