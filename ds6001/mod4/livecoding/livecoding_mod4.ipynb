    "Every year, candidates for Congress spend more and more on their campaigns. And that leads to every candidate taking a stand and promising to change the world on a whole host of issues. In Charlottesville, our local Representative in Congress, Bob Good, promises on his website to work on law and order, economy and trade, immigration, abortion, guns, rural broadband, and energy.\n",

    "It's a series of wild promises because there are 435 members of the House of Representatives, and the vast majority of policy work is conducted in committees and sub-committees. One representative is generally limited to serving on two committees and four sub-committees https://history.house.gov/Education/Fact-Sheets/Committees-Fact-Sheet2/ So, how, given this constraint, can an individual member of Congress promise to deliver policy changes in 7 different areas? The answer is: one member can't do that. Bob Good specifically serves on the Education and Labor committee, where he chairs the sub-committee on health, employment, labor, and pensions https://edworkforce.house.gov/issues/issue/?IssueID=43422, and on the budget committee https://budget.house.gov/about/members/\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The point here is that a campaign is a terrible way to learn about what a Member of Congress is really doing. As a quick experiment, try an internet search to find answers to the following questions: who is your representative in the House? What committees is this person serving on? What sub-committees? What bills have they sponsored? How have they voted on a particular bill, such as the SHOW up act of 2023, https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/139 . Which aims to reduce work-from-home privileges for federal employees? You will most likely find that these answers are findable, but not in a straightforward or quick way. I argue that information like this should be easy to access by the public.\n",

    "One excellent tool that can shed more light on the real actions of our elected representatives is the ProPublica Congress API https://projects.propublica.org/api-docs/congress-api/ , which allows anyone with the ability to access and API and parse JSON output the ability to see all of this information about any member of Congress, going back to 2001 or earlier Lhttps://projects.propublica.org/api-docs/congress-api/#scope-of-data . The problem is, you have to know what to do with an API to make use of this tool.\n",
